# bargain_di

A poor man's dependency injector. This package will allow you to register classes once and have the ability to
quickly initialize them. Main goals are to reduce parameter passing and to allow mocking during testing.


## Getting Started

### Register a type and it's initialization function.
### Request for the registered type.
